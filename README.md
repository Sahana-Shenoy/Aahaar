### Introduction
--- 189.2 million individuals are undernourished in India. (source)

--- Various organizations come forward to provide mid-day meals
to children, but some may not organize their schedule for meals
and this may lead to undernourished children or high cost per
head.

--- Adding money factor with a balanced diet helps organizations to
utilize their donation properly, give more facilities and feed
them for a long time without worrying about donations.

--- Using ML models, the random spending on vegetables and
groceries to fulfill the nutritional demand of children can be
optimized. It reduces the time to make a list. Web app built with
a Django framework integrates ML functionalities to provide a
user-friendly solution.

### Technologies 
  - Backend: 100% python
  - SQLite
  - Dynamic web project
  - VS code IDE
  - Django Embedded server

### Proposed Solution
* The same nutrient can be provided by
many food items. The ML model would
focus on helping organisations opt for
products that would fulfil the nutritional
requirements at minimum cost.
* The web app also updates the user with
information like government
entitlement norms per person, diet
plans, nutritional values of vegetables
etc.
