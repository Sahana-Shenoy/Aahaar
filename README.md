### Introduction
* 189.2 million individuals are undernourished in India. [source](https://www.indiafoodbanking.org/hunger#:~:text=189.2%20million%20people%20are%20undernourished%20in%20India.)

* Various organizations come forward to provide mid-day meals
to children, but some may not organize their schedule for meals
and this may lead to undernourished children or high cost per
head.

* Adding money factor with a balanced diet helps organizations to
utilize their donation properly, give more facilities and feed
them for a long time without worrying about donations.

* Using ML models, the random spending on vegetables and
groceries to fulfill the nutritional demand of children can be
optimized. It reduces the time to make a list. Web app built with
a Django framework integrates ML functionalities to provide a
user-friendly solution.

### Motivation
#### IMPACT OF COVID-19
* According to the United Nationâ€™s Policy
brief on the Impact of COVID-19 on
Children, 368.5 million children in 143
countries who usually rely on meal
programmes for reliable daily nutrition
will face malnutrition.
* Before the pandemic - 1.8 million
children undernourished in India every
year.
* Situation more complicated - multiple stressors - COVID-19, impoverished economic status, loss
of employment, poor and unhygienic living conditions, and lack of healthcare facilities.
* Are we prepared ?



### Technologies 
  - Backend: 100% python
  - SQLite
  - Dynamic web project
  - VS code IDE
  - Django Embedded server

### Proposed Solution
* The same nutrient can be provided by
many food items. The ML model would
focus on helping organisations opt for
products that would fulfil the nutritional
requirements at minimum cost.
* The web app also updates the user with
information like government
entitlement norms per person, diet
plans, nutritional values of vegetables
etc.
